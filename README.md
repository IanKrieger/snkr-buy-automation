    - `shoe.size = M 10`. Make sure shoe size specifies gender before, otherwise it will select first button with 10.
        - Valid Combos: `M 10`, `W 11.5`, `M 10 / W 11.5`
    - `credit.card.ccv = <ccv>`. This step assumes you have a credit card setup in your acct. Do that, it's easier.
    - `buy.shoe = false`. Switch this to true if you want an actual chance of buying shoe.
